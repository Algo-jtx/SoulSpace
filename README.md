## Setup

If you want to run this project locally or contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**

   * Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

   * Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

   * Familiarity with Git and GitHub is recommended.

   * Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a Linux-based system is recommended for consistent environment.

2. **Clone the repository from GitHub:**

   ```
   git clone <your-repository-url-here> # Replace with your actual GitHub repo URL
   ```

3. **Navigate into the project folder:**

   ```
   cd SoulSpace
   ```

4. **Backend Setup (Flask):**

   * Navigate into the `server` directory:

     ```
     cd server
     ```

   * Install Python dependencies using `pipenv`:

     ```
     pipenv install
     ```

   * Activate the virtual environment:

     ```
     pipenv shell
     ```

   * Run database migrations to set up your SQLite database:

     ```
     flask db upgrade
     ```

   * Start the Flask backend server:

     ```
     python app.py
     ```

     (The server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5555` by default)

5. **Frontend Setup (React):**

   * Open a **new terminal window/tab**.

   * Navigate back to the main project directory, then into the `client` directory:

     ```
     cd ../client
     ```

   * Install Node.js dependencies:

     ```
     npm install
     ```

   * Start the React development server:

     ```
     npm start
     ```

     (The React app will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`)

6. **Access the Application:**

   * Ensure both the Flask backend (`python app.py`) and the React frontend (`npm start`) are running in separate terminals.

   * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
